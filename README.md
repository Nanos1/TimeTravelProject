# TimeTravelProject
Time-travel problem: travel back in time and make as much profit as you can on the New York Stock Exchange!


THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE FOR THE TRAVEL TIME IN THE STOCK EXCHANGE:

1. The total number of shares 𝑠 that we buy per day 𝑑 should not exceed 10% of its volume
share 𝑠 per day 𝑑.
2. Likewise, the total number of shares 𝑠 we sell per day 𝑑 should not exceed 10% of its volume
share 𝑠 per day 𝑑.
3. If before the opening of the day 𝑑 we have in our possession n ≥ 0 shares 𝑠, then during the day 𝑑 no
we can buy a total of more than 𝑛 + 1 shares 𝑠.
